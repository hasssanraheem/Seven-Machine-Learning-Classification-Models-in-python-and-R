Seven Classification Models in Python and R

This repository contains implementations of seven major classification techniques in both Python and R. Each model is presented in its own folder with a dedicated dataset, clean code, and usage instructions. It is designed as a learning and reference resource for students, data scientists, and developers exploring classification techniques.

Each folder contains:

Python and R implementations of the model

A dataset for training and testing
Models Included

Logistic Regression – Linear classification for binary or multi-class problems

Decision Tree – Tree-based model for classification tasks

Random Forest – Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy

Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Classification with maximum margin hyperplanes

Kernel SVM – Non-linear classification using kernel trick

Naive Bayes – Probabilistic classification based on Bayes’ theorem

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Instance-based learning using proximity of data points
Datasets

Each model folder contains its own dataset tailored to demonstrate that specific classification technique.
Datasets are included directly within each subfolder so that each model can be run independently.
You may replace the provided datasets with your own data to experiment.
Objectives

Provide clean and reusable implementations of seven widely used classification models

Help learners understand how each technique works through code and datasets

Allow easy experimentation with different classification techniques
